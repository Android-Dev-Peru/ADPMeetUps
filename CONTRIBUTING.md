# CONTRIBUTING
---
**To contribute**
1. Please, write your Pull Requests providing a brief description, what were the main changes and how or why did you did what you did. If UI is altered, please provide a screenshot of how it used to look and how it looks now. We are going to define a Pull Request template later.
2. The development moves thanks to a Github Project. Please, read carefully all the reamining tasks and feel free to propouse new tasks linking the Github Issue.
3. Labels are always put by maintainers.
4. If you are not part of the organization team, please fork the repository and add your contributions through a Pull Request.
5. For new features, create a `feature/featureName` branch. For fixes: `bugfix/taskCode` or `bugfix/fixName`.
